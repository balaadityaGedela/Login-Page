This project name is "Login Page EJS"
This is made using express JS, node JS, html, css, js
I am trying to create a simpel login page but without any server
Idea: using a dictionary
It should contain username, password and submit button
If not regsitered create account which adds a new key,value pair to our existing dictionary,
IF wrong, it has to show an pop up saying wrong credentials,
if crct it has to redirect to a new page where it contains, may b try adding something.
