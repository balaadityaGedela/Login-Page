  <h1>Animals</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Koala bears have fingerprints so close to human fingerprints that they could interfere with crime scenes.</li>
    <li>Mantis shrimp can “punch” as fast as a .22 caliber bullet.</li>
    <li>Fish are the oldest known vertebrates. They live in water and are often covered in scales. Most fish have a bony skeleton. However, sharks and rays have a skeleton made of cartilage, a strong and flexible tissue.</li>
    <li>Millions of different kinds of animals live on Earth. Animals are found throughout the world, from the freezing polar zones to the hottest deserts. They live on land and in the water. They come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes.</li>
    <li>Scientists divide animals into two main groups. Animals that have a backbone are called vertebrates. Animals that do not have a backbone are called invertebrates. About 95 percent of all animals are invertebrates.</li>
    <li>Animals are living things. Like plants, animals need food and water to live. Unlike plants, which make their own food, animals feed themselves by eating plants or other animals. Animals can also sense what goes on around them. Their bodies allow them to move in reaction to their surroundings. They use their senses and movement to find food, mates, and safety.</li>
